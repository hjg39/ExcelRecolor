# ExcelRecolor 🎨📊

**ExcelRecolor** is a tiny Windows app that draws a transparent overlay on top of Excel and **recolors “Excel green” pixels** to a hue you choose — **purple by default**.

It’s intentionally lightweight: no Excel plugins, no workbook changes — just what you see on-screen.

> Built fast (with AI help) to solve a real problem. The code is functional-first, not architecture-first 😄
