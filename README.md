# ExcelRecolor 🎨📊

**ExcelRecolor** is a tiny Windows app that draws a transparent overlay on top of Excel and **recolors “Excel green” pixels** to a hue you choose — **purple by default**.

No Excel plugins, no workbook changes.  This is a windows app that doesn't interact with Excel but draws over it.

> Pls don't judge the messiness of the code layout which would not pass my professional coding standards in a million years.
