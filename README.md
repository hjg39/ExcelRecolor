# ExcelRecolor 🎨📊

**ExcelRecolor** is a tiny Windows app that draws a transparent overlay on top of Excel and **recolors “Excel green” pixels** to a hue you choose — **purple by default**.

No Excel plugins, no workbook changes.  This is a windows app that doesn't interact with Excel but draws over it.

> Thrown together with AI quickly. Pls no judge the messiness of the layout which would not pass coding standards in a hundred years.
