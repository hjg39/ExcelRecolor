# ExcelRecolor
A small app that creates a screen overlay that replaces green Excel pixels with a configurable hue, defaulting to Purple.

Made messily with AI to get it out quickly - pls do not judge the terrible layout, method naming, non-seperation of classes etc.

# Use

Simply update the config file with the degree in the colour wheel (0-359) of your target hue.
